/* 
This program print the calender of 2023

Steps:
1. First it creates a loop that goes through each month of the year 2023.
2. It then calls the function get_month_long to find out how many days are in the current month.
3. It then creates a loop that goes through each day of the current month.
4. It then prints out the day and the day of the week.
5. The day of the week is incremented each time by one, and when it reaches 7 it is reset to 1.
